# AdaptiveNearestNeighbors


Reference implementation 
Compare KNN to ANN based off of the recommendation from http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/pdf/algorithm/articulo/knnAdaptive.pdf 

* normalized, 
* cross validate
* created metrics 
* for both ann and knn 
* using different distances - euclidean and manhattan 

These calculations were verified on the dataset suggested in the paper. The plots obtained were an exact match to what was recommended. After which the same approach was applied on 3 more of the UCI data sets.
